## Weather App

This is a simple project that was used in a learning session to demonstrate main concepts in react. Specifically:

- Introducing JSX
- Rendering Elements
- Components and Props
- State and Lifecycle
- Handling Events
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- Forms
- Lifting State Up
- Thinking In React

This app takes a city name, and displays a list of cards with the weather for the search results

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Get an api key from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and configure your `.env` file as it is detailed in `.env-example`. Start the application, and visit the app. Begin searching for cities and it will display the weather for that city. You can also change the card background to blue, red, and green.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
